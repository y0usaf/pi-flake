# Fabric Recursive Decomposition

Use recursion for context size, not mere difficulty. If the relevant material fits one context, work directly. Otherwise pass only the root objective as `strings.task` and use one `fabric_exec` program to orient → delegate non-overlapping context-sized partitions → combine available results.

## Context is an external variable

Canonical RLM keeps oversized source context and intermediate products as addressable environment values instead of repeatedly serializing them through Main’s conversation. Within one `fabric_exec`, keep source handles, parsed values, partitions, and findings in QuickJS variables. Give each child only a context-sized slice or project-relative path, let it inspect that source with tools, and return only the compact synthesis. Do not inline an entire corpus into `strings.task` or a child prompt.

QuickJS bindings end with the current `fabric_exec` call. When decomposition must continue across turns, persist JSON-serializable bindings under a root-scoped `rlm/<rootId>/bindings/...` key in `mesh`, pass the key rather than the value, and have descendants load it with `mesh.get()`. Use a project-relative file plus a digest for values larger than `mesh.maxEventBytes`. Mesh bindings are project-visible and have no automatic TTL, so do not store secrets and delete them when the work is complete. `state` is for claims, evidence, certification, and goals—not scratch data. This explicit durable environment provides context-as-variable semantics without a persistent executable heap or a new workspace provider.

`rlm.query()` is `agents.run({ runner: "pi", recursive: true })`. Use plain `agent()` for a partition that fits one child context; reserve `rlm.query()` for a partition that remains oversized.

```ts
type Partition = { label: string; paths: string[]; recursive: boolean };
type RecursiveOutcome =
  | { partition: string; status: "completed"; finding: string }
  | { partition: string; paths: string[]; status: "failed" | "not_started"; error: string };

Coverage keeps the original proposal count, dispatched normalized partitions, completed work, and any merged overlaps. The result is compact on successful synthesis. Raw compact findings appear only when synthesis fails; full `FabricAgentResult` objects never return to the parent. `partial` is usable evidence with named gaps, not a request to rerun the tree. Failure records retain paths: retry only those paths with a plain agent or a targeted recursive query when their coverage matters, and never rerun successful partitions automatically.

Guardrails:

- Deduplicate and partition before spawning. Plain agents handle context-sized leaves; recursion is only for oversized partitions.
- Work in batches so an all-failed batch stops new spend. At most two top-level partitions may recurse; additional recursive proposals return as `not_started` with their paths.
- Partition edit ownership by path or use `worktree: true`; concurrent children must not edit the same files.
- `agents.maxDepth` bounds each recursive branch. It accepts any non-negative safe integer; `0` disables child spawning. The shared `agents.budgetUsd` check and `tokenBudget` are best-effort under concurrency because usage settles afterward; batches reduce, but cannot eliminate, overshoot.
- Reserve current-execution agent capacity for orientation and optional synthesis. Recursive descendants enforce their own process limits.
- `budget.remaining()` reflects completed usage only. When the ceiling matters, keep batches small rather than treating it as a reservation.
- Initial approval delegates only agent risk; network, execution, and write approvals are not inherited. Redirect a valuable drifting child with `agents.steer` rather than discarding its context.

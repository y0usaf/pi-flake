# Fabric Fusion

Use one `fabric_exec` call for a 2–8 model panel and a judge when at least two responses complete. The judge compares rather than merges responses; return a compact status/coverage/analysis envelope so the caller writes the final answer. Use fusion for model-diverse research or critique, not tactical work or a lookup. Set `strings.mode` to `act` for the acting variant below; empty or `compare` keeps this compare flow unchanged.

Pass every key: `strings.task`; JSON `strings.panel` as `Array<{ model, label? }>`; and optional `strings.thinking` as an empty string when unset. Labels are attribution only; thinking defaults to configured agent thinking. Compare mode also takes optional `strings.judge` and JSON `strings.tools` (defaults to `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `bash`). Act mode takes `strings.mode: "act"`, JSON `strings.panel` as 1–4 reference models, an explicit `strings.actor` model, and optional JSON `strings.actorTools` (defaults to `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`). It ignores `strings.judge` and `strings.tools`; reference tools are always fixed read-only.

Choose distinct models by intent: strongest available, budget-balanced with a frontier judge, or similar-latency models for faster fan-out. The default panel size is three. Cost is N panel calls plus a judge when comparison is possible. Reserve `panel.length + 1` top-level agent calls. Concurrent calls can overshoot observational token/USD checks because usage settles afterward; those settings are not hard concurrent reservations.

Panel members and the judge are plain, non-recursive agents, so deliberation is one level. `bash` enables web access through local search/fetch commands and requires execute approval. Concurrency is capped by `agents.maxConcurrent`; inner calls otherwise inherit provider limits and use `thinking` for reasoning effort.

Act mode costs exactly N reference calls plus exactly one actor call in a single parallel fan-out layer. The default recommended N is 1–2 (one reference plus an actor is a valid minimal act), with a hard maximum of 4. Prefer cheaper diverse references and the strongest reliable actor. Reusing a reference model as the actor is allowed when the goal is a bounded read-only second pass rather than model diversity; distinct models remain the default expectation. Tactical tasks should use a plain agent instead: act mode pays for the actor regardless of outcome and has no failure-only checkpoints — Fabric cannot observe nested actor tool-failure checkpoints at this level, so the actor is always one full call. `agentBudget`, `tokenBudget`, and concurrency settings are observational ceilings, not hard concurrent reservations, for references and actor alike. The default `actorTools` include `bash`, `edit`, and `write`: `bash` requires execute approval and `edit`/`write` mutate the working tree, so trim the list for sensitive runs.

For same-model role diversity, recommend `/skill:fabric-council` for the user to invoke; do not invoke another user-only skill yourself. Use a plain agent when competing model perspectives do not justify the cost.

## Completion criterion

Return `success`, `partial`, or `failed` with explicit panel coverage. Successful judging returns only the structured comparison; raw responses return only when judging fails or fewer than two models complete. A partial result is usable and must not trigger an automatic full-panel rerun. Failures retain label, canonical model key, and runner; retry only failed models or the judge when that missing coverage matters.

Act mode: success returns only `status`, `coverage`, `failures`, and `result` — reference advice stays private. Zero completed references fail before any actor spend. Some reference failures still run the actor and return `partial`. If the actor fails, return `partial` with `actorError` and the compact completed-reference advice as fallback so the caller can retry only the actor; never automatically rerun successful references.

# Fabric Ambient Actors

Choose and execute the matching profile directly; never bounce the user to another skill after they invoked this one. Never install a separate supervisor, advisor, or orchestration extension.

Choose from the first argument or infer from the request:

- `supervisor <goal>`: verify progress toward a concrete goal and steer only on missing work, drift, failure, or completion.
- `advisor [focus]`: review turns and surface only material correctness advice.

Hard pointer: read `<skill-dir>/references/setup.md` completely before setup and use its shared program. Always pass every named string, using an empty `model` when unset. Do not ask for details already present.

## Supervisor profile

Use `name=supervisor`, `events=["agent_settled","tool_error"]`, and `triggerTurn=true`. Build `instructions` from:

```text
You are an ambient supervisor for this goal:

<goal>
GOAL
</goal>

Review the supplied event and recent transcript as an outside observer. Return {"action":"silent"} while work advances. Return {"action":"message","message":"..."} only for material missing work at idle, drift, a stuck failure, or one concrete next action. Be direct, use at most three sentences, and do not repeat guidance, request credentials, or invent user decisions. When the requested result and validation are evident, return {"action":"stop","message":"Goal verified complete."}.
```

## Advisor profile

Use `name=advisor`, `events=["turn_end"]`, and `triggerTurn=false`. Append any requested focus to:

```text
You are an ambient peer advisor reviewing the main coding agent. Focus on correctness, missed constraints, risky assumptions, and cheaper paths. Inspect with read-only tools only when needed. Return {"action":"silent"} when work is on track; otherwise return {"action":"message","message":"..."} for one concrete, material observation. Cite evidence and a terse recommendation as advice, not an order. Do not repeat visible advice.
```

The supervisor can wake an idle session; the per-turn advisor must not.

## Completion criterion

Complete when setup returns an actor matching the selected profile, events, trigger policy, and native tools with no recreation warning. If warnings remain, report remediation without automatically rerunning setup. Otherwise report the profile, actor ID, and derived `/fabric messages`/`stop` commands; do not wait.

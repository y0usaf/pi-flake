# Fabric Supervisor

Create the supervisor with Fabric primitives; do not install a supervisor extension. Derive a concrete, measurable goal from the skill arguments or active request without asking for information already present.

Hard pointer: read `<skill-dir>/../fabric-ambient/references/setup.md` completely before setup, then use its program with:

- `strings.name`: `supervisor`
- `strings.events`: `["agent_settled","tool_error"]`
- `strings.triggerTurn`: `true`
- `strings.model`: model key or substring, or an empty string when unset
- `strings.instructions`: the prompt below with `GOAL` replaced

```text
You are an ambient supervisor for this goal:

<goal>
GOAL
</goal>

Review the supplied parent-session event and recent transcript as an outside observer, not a second implementer.

Return {"action":"silent"} while work is productively advancing. Return {"action":"message","message":"..."} only when material work is missing at idle, work is drifting, a tool error left it stuck, or one concrete next action is needed. Keep guidance direct and at most three sentences. Do not repeat prior guidance, request credentials, or invent user decisions.

The goal is complete only when the requested result and relevant validation are evident. Then return {"action":"stop","message":"Goal verified complete."}.
```

Idle/error events avoid a model run on every turn. `triggerTurn: true` lets a material steer resume an idle Main session.

## Completion criterion

Complete only when setup returns a `supervisor` with both events, read-only native tools, `triggerTurn: true`, and no recreation warning. If warnings remain, report the required remediation without recreating or retrying automatically. Otherwise report the goal, actor ID, and derived `/fabric messages`/`stop` commands; do not wait.

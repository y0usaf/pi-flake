# Fabric Advisor

Create the advisor with Fabric primitives; do not install an advisor extension. Treat skill arguments as an optional focus.

Hard pointer: read `<skill-dir>/../fabric-ambient/references/setup.md` completely before setup, then use its program with:

- `strings.name`: `advisor`
- `strings.events`: `["agent_settled","tool_error"]`
- `strings.triggerTurn`: `false`
- `strings.model`: model key or substring, or an empty string when unset
- `strings.instructions`: the prompt below, with the requested focus appended

```text
You are an ambient peer advisor for the main coding agent. Review the supplied parent-session event and recent transcript as an outside observer, not a second executor. Focus on correctness, missed user constraints, risky assumptions, edge cases, and cheaper paths to the requested outcome. Inspect the workspace with read-only tools only when evidence is needed.

Prefer silence. Return {"action":"silent"} when work is on track. Return {"action":"message","message":"..."} only for one concrete, material observation that could prevent wasted work or a defect while there is still time to act. Cite the evidence and recommendation tersely as advice, not an order. Do not repeat advice visible in the transcript or raise minor style preferences unless the user required them.
```

`agent_settled` and `tool_error` target idle/failure decision points without reviewing every turn. `triggerTurn: false` lets advice join the main loop without forcing a turn.

## Completion criterion

Complete only when setup returns an `advisor` with both events, read-only native tools, `triggerTurn: false`, and no recreation warning. If warnings remain, report the required remediation without recreating or retrying automatically. Otherwise report the focus, actor ID, and derived `/fabric messages`/`stop` commands; do not wait.

/**
 * Engine lifecycle for a pi session: creation, revival, and the reset notice.
 *
 * Kept free of pi imports so the lifecycle is testable directly. The rule it
 * enforces is that **reviving the namespace is part of creating an engine**,
 * never a separate step a caller has to remember.
 *
 * That separation was a real defect. pi tears extensions down on reload
 * unconditionally, but only re-emits session_start when the extension has
 * registered UI, commands, a shutdown handler, or an error listener. An
 * extension with none of those got the teardown and not the startup, so the
 * next tool call quietly built a fresh engine with an empty namespace. Cells
 * kept working perfectly; every variable was simply gone.

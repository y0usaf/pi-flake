/**
 * Wire protocol between EngineManager (host) and the Bun guest process.
 *
 * Transport: line-delimited JSON on a dedicated pipe (fd 3), never on stdout.
 *
 * Two properties make the channel trustworthy, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. Separation. The guest's stdout and stderr carry only user output, so a
 *      cell that prints JSON cannot be parsed as protocol traffic. Sharing one
 *      channel would let ordinary output alter the engine's view of a cell.
 *   2. Authentication. Every envelope carries a nonce the host mints at spawn
 *      and the guest erases from its environment before running any cell. Code
 *      inside a cell cannot recover it, so even a deliberate write to fd 3
 *      cannot forge a message.
 *
 * Together they make a cell unable to report its own outcome — it can only run.

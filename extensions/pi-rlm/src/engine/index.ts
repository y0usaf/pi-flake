/**
 * EngineManager — the host half of the evaluator.
 *
 * Owns one persistent Bun guest process, speaks the line-JSON protocol over a
 * private pipe, and exposes the execute / snapshot / restore API the `execute`
 * tool is built on.
 *
 * The guarantees it is responsible for:
 *   - one cell runs at a time, in submission order;
 *   - output is attributed to the cell that produced it, and stops the moment
 *     that cell is cancelled;
 *   - the namespace outlives errors, cancellation, and session resume.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE.md explains how these are achieved and why they matter.

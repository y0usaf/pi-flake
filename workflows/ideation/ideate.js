// Ideation workflow for pi-loom.
// Multi-model debate: every participant is a plain "ideator" — no personas.
// Diversity comes from different model weights/corpora, not role prompts.
//
// Each round runs in two passes:
//   1. chain — ideators speak sequentially; each sees everything said before
//      them this round and must engage it (attack, defend, concede, merge).
//   2. open floor — everyone sees the full chain and answers the strongest
//      objection to their own position (parallel; all inputs are ready).
// A judge agent with a structured verdict checks consensus after each round.
//
// The loop stops at consensus, a hard round cap, or a human checkpoint.
//
// Launch args (JSON):
//   topic: string (required)
//   context?: string
//   maxRounds?: 1-10 (default 5)
//   models?: string[] — ideator model ids (default: the four enabled models)
//   judgeModel?: string — defaults to models[0]
